# July LeetCoding Challenge

This is a challenge by [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/) consisting of 30 daily problems over the month of July. A problem is added each day, and we have 24 hours to make a valid submission. I will be uploading my solutions in this repository after the deadline to make a valid submission for the given problem has passed.

This month, to do things a little differently than last month, I have decided to weekly change the language I code in. 

Week One: C++

Week Two: Java
